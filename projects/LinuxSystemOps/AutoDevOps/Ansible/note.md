# Ansible Learning Notes and Best Practices

## benefits

Ansible is an agentless automation tool that by default manages machines over the SSH protocol. 
Once installed, Ansible does not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running. 
When Ansible manages remote machines, it does not leave software installed or running on them, 
so thereâ€™s no real question about how to upgrade Ansible when moving to a new version.

## Ansible Control node

Currently Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2 (version 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed. 
This includes Red Hat, Debian, CentOS, macOS, any of the BSDs, and so on. 
Windows is not supported for the control node.

## Ansible Managed node

ssh with sftp enabled and python installed.

## Install Ansible

```shell script
sudo yum install ansible || sudo apt install ansible -y || (
    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
    sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
    sudo apt install ansible -y
)

```

## Ansible command shell completion

You can install `python-argcomplete` from EPEL on Red Hat Enterprise based distributions, and or from the standard OS repositories for many other distributions.
```shell script
sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3
```

## Ansible configuration file

Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be searched for in the following order:

   - ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)
    
   - ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
    
   - ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
    
   - /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Ansible will process the above list and use the first file found, all others are ignored.

## Ad-hoc command

### pipe('|') support
shell module support pipe('|'), but command module does not.

```shell script
ansible -i hosts prod -m comamnd -a 'pgrep ftp'
ansible -i hosts prod -a 'pgrep ftp'  # default module is command
ansible -i hosts prod -m shell -a 'ps -ef|grep ftp'
ansible -i hosts prod --become -m raw -a "ps -ef|grep ftp"
```
